    """Attach one Engram ModuleSpec to the hybrid layer types the configuration selects.

    A hybrid stack picks a per-layer submodule spec by pattern symbol, so the memory is attached
    per layer type rather than to a single layer spec. Every configured layer ID is resolved
    through the pattern to the submodule fields the stack may build that layer from, and a field
    that cannot carry the memory - a Mamba layer, or a layer type this stack spec leaves as
    IdentityOp - is rejected here. Checking the spec rather than the pattern alone is what keeps
    a mis-selected layer from silently building no memory at all.

    Some symbols map to more than one field: HybridStack chooses among them from the layer
    config (``experimental_attention_variant='gdn2'``, ``mla_down_proj_fusion``,
    ``qk_layernorm``), and H and W layers fall back to the C fields when the stack spec has no
    dedicated ``hca_layer`` or ``window_layer``. The memory is attached to every field the
    stack spec provides for the symbol, so it follows whichever one is built; at least one must
    exist.

    MoE ('E') layers are rejected under ``cuda_graph_impl='transformer_engine'``: the MoE
    capture scopes graph MoE layers, and the Engram lookup has data-dependent shapes.

    The spec is copied before mutation: stack specs are module-level singletons that several
    builders share, so attaching in place would carry a stale EngramConfig into unrelated models.
    Layer selection itself stays in TransformerLayer, which builds the module only for the
    configured global layer numbers, so attaching to a field that also builds other layers is
    harmless.
